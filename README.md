# MERN stack tutorial | 8 hour course

A 8 hour MERN stack tutorial by Dave Gray on youtube. After my commitment to learning the MERN stack it was a natural progression. 

## What i learned

- Middleware 
- Controllers
- Redux & RTK Query
- Authentication & Authorization within a MERN Stack
- JWT Auth

I am now ready to create my own project to solidify the knowledge i have learnt from the past few courses. This will nbe the stunt-team project in my repository on github.
